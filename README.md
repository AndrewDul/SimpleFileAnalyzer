# SimpleFileAnalyzer

This simple Java program analyzes text files by providing the total number of words used in the text and the count of occurrences of each word. The project consists of two packages:

- `lib`: Contains the `TextAnalyzer` class responsible for the logic of text analysis.
- `main`: Contains the `TextAnalysisApp` class, which serves as the entry point to run the application.

To run the program, place a `sample.txt` file with the text to be analyzed in the root directory of the project and execute the `TextAnalysisApp` class.
