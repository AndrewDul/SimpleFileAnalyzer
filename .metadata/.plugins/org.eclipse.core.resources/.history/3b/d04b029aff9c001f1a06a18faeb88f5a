During week 4 part 3 we look at Stream pipelines including common intermediate and terminal operations, how streams can be built and collected from, and how streams can utilise parallelism.

You were briefly introduced to stream pipelines and a few common operations such as filter (along with lambda expressions) earlier in the module, however, this material will look at streams in much more depth. Stream pipelines work hand in hand with lambda expressions and collections, which have been the last two topics we have covered. There is a lot of material covered in the slides, however, as you will see in the lab exercise, your task is largely based on observing the behaviour of stream pipelines, and being able to adapt these to produce your own solutions. So long as you grasp an understanding of the fundamentals, this will be good for now â€“ you would then logically be able to take advantage of some of the more advanced aspects as needed in the future.
